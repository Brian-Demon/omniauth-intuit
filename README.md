# OmniAuth Intuit

**Note:** This gem is designed to work with the unreleased OmniAuth 1.0 library. It will not be officially released on RubyGems.org until OmniAuth 1.0 is released.

This gem contains the LinkedIn strategy for OmniAuth.

Intuit uses the OAuth 1.0a flow, you can read about it here: https://ipp.developer.intuit.com/0010_Intuit_Partner_Platform/0030_Intuit_Anywhere/0036_Coding_Your_App/0050_OAuth_for_Intuit_Anywhere

## How To Use It

Usage is as per any other OmniAuth 1.0 strategy. So let's say you're using Rails, you need to add the strategy to your `Gemfile` along side omniauth:

    gem 'omniauth'
    gem 'omniauth-intuit'

Of course if one or both of these are unreleased, you may have to pull them in directly from github e.g.:

    gem 'omniauth', :git => 'https://github.com/intridea/omniauth.git'
    gem 'omniauth-intuit', :git => 'https://github.com/jaigouk/omniauth-intuit.git'

Once these are in, you need to add the following to your `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :intuit, "consumer_key", "consumer_secret" 
    end

You will obviously have to put in your key and secret, which you get when you register your app with LinkedIn (they call them API Key and Secret Key). 

Now just follow the README at: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth

## Running example code

`shotgun -s thin -d -p 3000 config.ru`     

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

- Fork the project.
- Make your feature addition or bug fix.
- Add tests for it. This is important so I donâ€™t break it in a future version unintentionally.
- Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
- Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
